This repo contains the data and code for the analysis in 'Non-linear averaging explains population growth in thermally variable environments'. 

This repo is organized into 3 main folders: 


[Raw data](https://github.com/JoeyBernhardt/thermal-variability/tree/master/Tetraselmis_experiment/data-raw) contains the raw population abundance data from the lab experiments with T. tetrahele. These csvs are unaltered, raw outputs from the FlowCAM. 


[Processed data](https://github.com/JoeyBernhardt/thermal-variability/tree/master/Tetraselmis_experiment/data-processed) contains all intermediate/processed data or data collected from other sources. 


[Code for analysis](https://github.com/JoeyBernhardt/thermal-variability/tree/master/Tetraselmis_experiment/R) contains all the code needed to produce the analysis and figures.
